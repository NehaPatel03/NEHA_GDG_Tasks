# Data Exploration for Crab Insights

This project focuses on exploring the Crabs Dataset, which contains various physical attributes of crabs used to classify their species. The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify trends, and visualize the relationships between different features using tools like histograms, box plots, and pair plots. The dataset is preprocessed using Normalization and Standardization techniques to ensure all features are on a similar scale, improving the effectiveness of any subsequent analysis or machine learning models.

The project uses Python along with key libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for preprocessing tasks. This process ensures that the data is cleaned, scaled, and ready for any further analysis or model implementation. The focus of this project is primarily on data exploration and preparation, providing valuable insights into the structure of the dataset and its features.
